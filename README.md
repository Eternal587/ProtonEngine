# Proton Engine
## 3d Engine for C++
Proton Engine is a personal project to make a 3d engine from scratch using C++ and OpenGL, and make a crossplatform 3d Engine

NOTE:
I am Currently in the Proccess of reworking the engine from scratch check [Here](https://github.com/Eternal587/ProtonEngine/tree/vulkan-recode) to see my progress. Because im being given this oppurtunity to recode I want to make It the right way. Classes, Structs, Cleaner Code, and Easier one command Compilation for Windows, Linux and MacOS

I plan on making a game using the Engine called [Shattered Reality](https://trello.com/b/k7bogwtW/shattered-reality-planning) but for now that project is more of goal for this engine, I want the lighting, physics, everything to be build around my goals for shattered reality

As well I would like to impliment custom shaders for people using Proton Engine for their games I want Proton Engine to be easy to setup and use for people not fammilar with it's internals

I will be making custom class's and structs for Proton Engine using Header files and such, so I will be providing docs whenever I start getting more serious into it being an engine

New Progress Timeline
```
1: Setup Vulkan Rendering 
2: Rework Shaders
3: Rework Workshop System
4: Optimize OPTIMIZE OPTIMIZE!!!
```

NOTE:
This is my current path, things may change as I am littearly only on step 1, as well I might rewrite Proton Engine If needed, this is my first c++ Project after all, But I do want it to be good


Planned Features
```
Full Map Editor
Weapons,
Lighting/Shaders,
Easy Script Building In C++
Optimized Graphics
Releases for Windows, Linux, and MacOS
```
