# Proton Engine
## 3d Engine for C++
Proton Engine is a personal project to make a 3d engine from scratch using C++ and OpenGL, and make a crossplatform 3d Engine

NOTE:
for now releases will be for MacOS, I will work on exporting to Windows **soon** But until I have a **serious/semicompleted** release I will not be spending the time to get a windows vm setup for exporting to windows

I plan on making a game using the Engine called [Shattered Reality](https://trello.com/b/k7bogwtW/shattered-reality-planning) but for now that project is more of goal for this engine, I want the lighting, physics, everything to be build around my goals for shattered reality

As well I would like to impliment custom shaders for people using Proton Engine for their games I want Proton Engine to be easy to setup and use for people not fammilar with it's internals

I will be making custom class's and structs for Proton Engine using Header files and such, so I will be providing docs whenever I start getting more serious into it being an engine

STAGES
```
1: Setup OpenGL
2. Setup Shaders
3. Clean Code, make structs and classes for objects to clean up my code
4. Start Releasing for Windows and Linux
5. Optimize 3d Rendering
6. Add Map Loader and Editor
7. Add Graphical Settings Options (Low, Medium, Quality, Ultra) 
8. Allow for Custom Shaders to be used
```

NOTE:
This is my current path, things may change as I am littearly only on step 1, as well I might rewrite Proton Engine If needed, this is my first c++ Project after all, But I do want it to be good
